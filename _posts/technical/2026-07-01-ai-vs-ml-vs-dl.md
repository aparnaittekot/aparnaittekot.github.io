## 🧠 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### What is AI?
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the **broad concept** of building machines that can **think, reason, and act intelligently**, similar to humans.

AI systems may follow rules or make decisions, and **they don’t always need to learn from data**.

### Examples
- Chess-playing  
- Voice assistants  

**Key idea:**  
> AI is the **goal** — making machines intelligent.

## 📊 Machine Learning (ML)

### What is Machine Learning?
**Machine Learning (ML)** is a **subset of AI** where machines **learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed**.

The system improves automatically as it sees more data.

### Examples
- Spam email detection  
- YouTube / Netflix recommendations  
- Fraud detection  

**Key idea:**  
> ML is **how machines learn** to achieve AI.

## 🧬 Deep Learning (DL)

### What is Deep Learning?
**Deep Learning (DL)** is a **subset of Machine Learning** that uses **multi-layer neural networks** to learn **complex patterns**.

It works best with large amounts of unstructured data like images, audio, and video.

### Examples
- Face recognition  
- Speech-to-text systems  
- Self-driving car vision  
- Image and text generation  

**Key idea:**  
> DL learns **very complex patterns** using neural networks.


## 🚀 When to Use What?
- Use **AI** when rule-based logic is enough  
- Use **ML** when patterns exist in data  
- Use **DL** when data is large and complex
