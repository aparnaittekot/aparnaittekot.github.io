Today is India’s independence day. Here are some interesting facts:
1. India was under the oppression of British rule for almost 150 years. It was in the year 1947 that it finally gained independence.
2. Jana Gana Mana by Rabindranath Tagore is the national anthem of India and the version that we all sing is actually the shrunken version (52 seconds). The original version has about 5 verses and it reflects the country’s independence struggle, culture and values. It was formally adopted as the national anthem in the year 1950.
3. The Indian national flag is nicknamed Tiranga and it has 4 colours in it. It was adopted officially on 22nd July 1947. 
       - The saffron colour in the flag denotes courage, sacrifice and valour.
       - The white colour in the flag denotes purity, peace and tranquility.
       - The green colour in the flag denotes growth, agriculture and hope.
       - The blue colour of the Ashok Chakra (center of the flag) in the flag denotes the continuous progress of the country.
