Below are the `12 music notes` in western music

> A --- A#(or Bb) ---- B ---- C --- C#(or Db) --- D --- D#(or Eb) --- E --- F --- F#(or Gb) --- G --- G#(or Ab) --- A
{: .prompt-info }

Note : `#` is pronounced as Sharp and `b` as Flat. For example: A# is `A Sharp` and Bb is `B flat`. 

### Formula
Here's the formula to construct a minor scale.
```
Formula : W, H, W, W, H, W, W
W means Whole step (For example, from A to B, it is a whole step as it has two hops)
H means Half step (For example, from A to A#, it is a half step as it has one hop)
```

Here's a trick to remember this:

A minor

```
A --- B --- C --- D --- E --- F --- G --- A
   W     H     W     W     H     W     W
```


B minor
```
B --- C# --- D --- E --- F# --- G --- A --- B
   W      H     W     W      H     W     W

... and it goes on for all 12 notes.
