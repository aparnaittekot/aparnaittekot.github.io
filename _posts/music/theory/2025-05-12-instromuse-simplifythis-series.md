I'm starting a weekly series of "SimplifyThis" where you folks can add your inputs on concepts on music which you find it hard to learn. The outcome of this series is that I provide a simplified explanation for the same in the learning mode you prefer and make learning easier :)
Here's the form for you to fill 
Please do submit your ideas here for [SimplifyThis Series 1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUWHoqH0lkCoM0AAq0nk-g-mvjI7HEKlYibq1EZJZEC1bfrA/viewform). This closes on 17th May for series 1.

Here's the view of the items added so far:
