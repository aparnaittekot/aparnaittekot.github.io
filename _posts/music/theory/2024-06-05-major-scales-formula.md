Below are the `12 music notes` in western music

> A --- A#(or Bb) ---- B ---- C --- C#(or Db) --- D --- D#(or Eb) --- E --- F --- F#(or Gb) --- G --- G#(or Ab) --- A
{: .prompt-info }

Note : `#` is pronounced as Sharp and `b` as Flat. For example: A# is `A Sharp` and Bb is `B flat`. 

### Formula
Here's the formula to construct a major scale.
```
Formula : W, W, H, W, W, W, H 
W means Whole step (For example, from A to B, it is a whole step as it has two hops)
H means Half step (For example, from A to A#, it is a half step as it has one hop)
```

Here's a trick to remember this:

### Constructing major scales

A major

```
A --- B --- C# --- D --- E --- F# --- G# --- A
   W     W      H     W     W      W      H
```


B major
```
B --- C# --- D# --- E --- F# --- G# --- A# --- B
   W      W      H     W      W      W      H
```

C major
```
C --- D --- E --- F --- G --- A --- B --- C
   W     W     H     W     W     W     H
```

... and it goes on for all 12 notes. 


### Basic major scales
* A major scale: `A – B – C# – D – E – F# – G# – A`
* Bb major scale: `Bb – C – D – Eb – F – G – A – Bb`
* B major scale: `B – C# – D# – E – F# – G# – A# – B`
* C major scale: `C – D – E – F – G – A – B – C`
* C# major scale: `C# – D# – E# (=F) – F# – G# – A# – B# (=C) – C#`
* Db major scale: `Db – Eb – F – Gb – Ab – Bb – C – Db`
* D major scale: `D – E – F# – G – A – B – C# – D`
* Eb major scale: `Eb – F – G – Ab – Bb – C – D – Eb`
* E major scale: `E – F# – G# – A – B – C# – D# – E`
* F major scale: `F – G – A – Bb – C – D – E – F`
* F# major scale: `F# – G# – A# – B – C# – D# – E# (=F) – F#`
* Gb major scale: `Gb – Ab – Bb – Cb (=B) – Db – Eb – F – Gb`
* G major scale: `G – A – B – C – D – E – F# – G`
* Ab major scale: `Ab – Bb – C – Db – Eb – F – G – Ab`


### Pointers
[1] From A to B note, it is 2 hops for a Whole step. (DO NOT COUNT number of notes). 
`A -> A# -> B`

[2] `Keep it simple` : Make sure to use the notations in such a way that the character is not repeated for simplicity.

For example for C# Major:
`C# – D# – E# – F# – G# – A# – B# – C#`

The order (C# – D# – E# – F# – G# – A# – C – C#) can be avoided as C is repeated in the form of C and C#. Similarly the order, (C# – D# – F – F# – G# – A# – B# – C#) can be avoided as F is repeated in form of F and F#.

[3] `Using sharp or flat scale` : If you cannot do [1] on a note, use the # (sharp) or b (flat) versions of the note to form the scale. 

For example for D#, the order is:
(D# – F – G – G# – A# – C – D – D#)
This is not simple to use and this cannot be converted like mentioned in [1].
Hence you can use Eb (flat) which is same as D#. 

`Eb – F – G – Ab – Bb – C – D – Eb`
