<i>When you all get up in the morning, what are few things that gives you <b>purpose in life</b>?.</i> 

<br>
<br>
Why did I pose this question? Because not everyone has any purpose in life and a life without purpose is monotonous to most, if not everyone. 
</div>

## Reality of life
<div align="justify">
Let's get to the reality of life. Life is majorly survival and a race to succeed. Many folks have days that are not satisfying to them. The misery creeps up on people. We start thinking about dreadful Mondays, go to work, they wait till the next break and cycle repeats. Monotonous life is not what everyone likes and noone wants it. 
</div>
<br>
Let’s come to the light side of this, though we come to this kind of situation, we have certain control of situations that can be done to make sure we change the circumstances. The highlight of what I mean is a change. `Change in mindset and change in circumstances`.

When we do the right things with the right mindset, we can get back on the flow. Ikigai helps to identify what is the right thing to do for certain individuals with a sense of purpose and able to work with almost no effort. 


How to create a purpose?
The Japanese invented a philosophy that stands for
Ikigai,
 which stands for reason. So this helps us determine what it is we want to wake up for in the morning.  


So when we do something that we love, how do we really feel about it? We just keep doing it and
 there’s a flow there. You don’t stop no matter what. Ikigai is something that helps us identify the ingredients that you need to stay in this state, make our pursuit consistent and be happy.


When we do the right things with the right mindset, we can get back on the flow. Ikigai helps to identify what is the right thing
 to do for certain individuals with a sense of purpose and able to work with almost no effort. 

## The Beautiful Ingredients
The 4 key ingredients
Let’s consider this guy John who is part of the toastmaster club and see how he can fit in the Ikigai. 

Something that we are good at
Intro
Everyone has a skill set. We can learn any skill. We are also born with different abilities like IG, empathy, physical strength,
 etc. John has skills to code at work. 

Negative aspect
Oftentimes we see people keep giving efforts to improve what they are bad at. That’s not really imperative. And what happens if
 we do this, we keep rejecting the best part of us. 

What to do about it
Why not focus on what you are good at and become great at it rather than become mediocre at the best?


Love to do
Intro
This might seem very obvious. Fulltime Youtube content creator. You love the editing and script part of it. 

Negative aspect
You hate filming. 

What to do about it
You could try to outsource that part alone to someone else, try to change locations to make it interesting. Mindset is the key aspect
 here and focus comes with what you love. But if they see that these things are really not making that person happy, it’s definitely a better idea to find something else to do. Sometimes intuition works here too.

We have to get paid
Intro
Some say money isn’t important or shouldn’t be a factor. But is that the reality, it pays the bills. To make our efforts sustainable
 they must generate some sort of an income.

Negative aspect
If you don’t see the activities as money generating, it’s just a side hustle. 

What to do about it
And it could also be that the money generated is not what they love, but it helps in the pursuit of the goals of life. 


The world should need it
Intro
Now we have to do something that benefits the world. If they don’t it’s simply passion. So the needs of the world can be in any
 flavor. 

Some of us are already it : Someone takes out the trash, cleans up the mess. 

Negative aspect
Most folks are just doing their passion that just involves and does not do anything to the world.

What to do about it
You can do some market research to find the market's demands. Look at wider perspectives how we, with our skill sets can be make
 a difference
