Can you imagine a species can fight fungal infection? Yes. Frogs can! 

### The Infection

A fungus `Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis` is affecting lots of specifies world wide [1]. 

### How does Frogs protect themselves?

PhD candidate `Nicholas Wu` from UQ’s School of Biological Sciences said the unique qualities of frog skin is what was allowing the fungus to have such a devastating impact.

“Frogs are particularly susceptible to the fungus because of their thin-permeable skin, through which they breathe, drink and exchange salts,” he said.

“The fungus feeds on the skin and directly damages it, meaning they can’t regulate themselves and die as a result.”

The researchers extracted skin and blood samples from infected green tree frogs (Litoria caerulea) to determine how the fungus damages skin function.

### More problems?

“We found that a frog’s natural response to fighting the infection was likely causing even more problems,” Mr Wu said.

“Frogs shed their old skin in attempt to remove the fungus and this process – called sloughing – helps restore the skin function temporarily.

“But it also causes the skin to be thinner and more permeable, placing the frog at greater risk of infection.”

The fungus is rapidly affecting amphibians, with the majority of chytrid-susceptible species already endangered, including the corroboree frog native to Australia’s Southern Tablelands.

“And for humans, frogs can help keep a check on nuisance insects like flies and mosquitoes, which can act as disease vectors.

“The properties of amphibian skin have untapped potential for biomedical and drug research, so there are very real and direct human impacts.

“Frogs are critical to our world’s health – it’s time we step up and protect these precious species.”
